## Pygame Documentation Overview

### Accessing Documentation

Obviously you can visit pygame.org/docs to see the documentation, 
but the documentation can also be launched with `python -m pygame.docs`

### Generating the Documentation

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.6 or higher is required
- Install Sphinx (`pip install Sphinx==4.5.0`)

Steps:
1. Fork the Pygame repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository in the terminal (`cd "path/to/pygame"`)
3. Run the following command to generate the documentation: `python setup.py docs`

This will create a new folder under the `docs` folder. 
In `docs/generated`, you will find a local copy of the pygame documentation.

You can launch this by clicking on index.html or by running the command
`python -m docs` from the pygame folder. (The same as manually running
__main__.py in `docs/`). The docs launch command will direct you to the
pygame website if there aren't any locally generated docs.

There is also a `docs --fullgeneration` or `docs --f` command for regenerating
everything regardless of whether Sphinx thinks it should be regenerated. This
is useful when editing the theme files (e.g., CSS).

###  Contributing

Contributing to the documentation is an excellent way to help improve the Pygame 
library. If you spot any grammatical mistakes or errors in the docs, here's how 
you can get involved.

For simple things, no issue is necessary -- but if you want to change
something complex it would be best to open an issue first.

Some background that may help with changes: pygame's documentation
is written in rst files, which stands for "ReStructured Text." We use Sphinx
([Sphinx Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)) to convert
these rst files into html, which are then hosted on the pygame website.

Sphinx has a good ReStructured Text primer to learn the basics:
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html

Contributing steps:
1. **Identify an improvement:** You can create an issue on GitHub to discuss
your idea or find existing issues related to the documentation.
2. **Find the file to edit:** Most documentation files are located in the
`docs/reST/ref/` folder. Alternatively, you can use the "Edit on GitHub"
button on the documentation page, which will take you directly to the relevant
file on GitHub.
3. **Download the pygame source:** Fork the Pygame repository and clone it to your
local machine using a Git client.
4. **Make your changes:** Implement your changes in the relevant `.rst` file.
5. **Generate the documentation:** Follow the steps outlined in the "Generating
the Documentation" section to test your changes locally.
6. **Commit and create a pull request:** Commit your changes to your forked
repository and create a pull request.
     - Ensure that the pull request has a clear and informative title and description

## Documentation Style

The pygame documentation files have developed the convention of a 79 character
line limit, from PEP8.

They also use a 3 space indent.

This is meant to be a place for explanations of things that may confuse people
in the future.

### Hidden modules

Pygame still has documentation for the old cdrom and Overlay modules, which
are discontinued in SDL2 based pygame (pygame 2). It just doesn't show them,
because `docs/reST/themes/classic/elements.html` now has a list of
"blacklisted" modules to not put into the top bar. It also uses this for the
experimental sdl2_video docs.

### Styling / Themes

CSS rules for the generated HTML come from
`docs/reST/themes/classic/static/pygame.css_t`. This, in turn, inherits rules
from Sphinx's basic.css, which is autogenerated when Sphinx builds.

This is an example of a
[Sphinx static template](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html#static-templates)
